<p>Dear Dr. Mansoor,</p>
<hr />

<p>
  I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my growing concern
  about the security measures currently in place at our college. As a dedicated
  student, I deeply value the safe and supportive environment that our
  institution strives to provide. However, recent incidents on campus have
  raised significant apprehensions among the student body regarding our overall
  security. <p>Over the past few weeks, there have been reports of unauthorized
  individuals gaining access to our campus facilities. Additionally, several
  students, including myself, have observed areas around the campus where
  lighting is inadequate, making these spots potentially dangerous during the
  evening hours. These issues have understandably led to a heightened sense of
  vulnerability among students.</p>
</p>
<p>
  I kindly request a meeting with you or the appropriate security personnel to
  discuss these concerns and potential solutions further. I am confident that,
  together, we can create a more secure and reassuring environment for everyone
  at college.
</p>
<p>
  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt
  response.
</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Jameel Shah,</p>
